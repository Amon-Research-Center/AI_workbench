\begin{abstract}
We integrate the Base Morphic Field (BMF), a Lorentzian scalar field unifying gravity, electrodynamics, and Faraday induction, with Sheldrake's morphic resonance, positing non-local memory fields governing self-organizing systems. Addressing Williamson's skepticism (Modern Wisdom #379, 49:57) that such fields cannot be universal, we argue they are, but selective perception limits detection to impactful effects, as per Amon's ``reverse memory'' (1979). This framework derives conservation laws, stability, and falsifiable predictions, recovering classical limits and proposing tests in physics (BEC quenches, optical cavities) and biology (telepathic learning). It repairs foundational gaps, enabling breakthroughs in cosmology, quantum biology, and consciousness.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Sheldrake's morphic resonance posits non-local fields storing collective memory, enabling phenomena like accelerated learning across species. Williamson (Modern Wisdom #379, 49:57) questions their universality, suggesting limited scope. Amon's BMF, with scalar field \(\phi\), counters that such fields are universal, but ``we only pickup what effects us'' (Amon, 2025), explaining selective detection. This paper unifies BMF and morphic resonance, modeling ``reverse memory'' (Amon, 1979) as emergent from \(\phi\)'s dynamics.

\section{Axioms and Kinematics}
\begin{axiom}[Base Morphic Field]
A scalar field \(\phi\) on \((\mathcal{M},g_{\mu\nu})\) with vacuum \(\phi_0\) and action density \(\mathcal{L}(\phi,\partial\phi;g,M)\), incorporating morphic resonance \(M\).
\end{axiom}
\begin{axiom}[Selective Morphic Resonance]
Morphic fields \(M\) couple to \(\phi\), transmitting patterns selectively perceived when impactful, bounded by Lyapunov stability.
\end{axiom}
\begin{axiom}[Locality with Non-Local Memory]
\(\mathcal{L}\) is diffeomorphism-invariant; local polynomials in \(\phi\), with non-local \(M\) integrals up to finite order.
\end{axiom}
\begin{axiom}[Universal Stability]
\(V(\phi)\) is bounded below at \(\phi_0\); perturbations decay, enabling universal memory accessible via impactful interactions.
\end{axiom}

\section{Dynamics}
\begin{definition}[Hybrid Action]
\[
S[\phi,g,M] = \int_{\mathcal{M}} \sqrt{-g}\,\Big(\tfrac12 g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\,\partial_\nu\phi - \frac{\lambda}{4}(\phi-\phi_0)^4 + f(\phi,M)F^2 + \kappa \int M(\phi',\partial\phi') d\phi'\Big)\, d^4x
\]
with morphic coupling \(\kappa M\).
\end{definition}
Euler–Lagrange yields:
\[
\square_g \phi + V'(\phi) + \frac{\delta (\kappa M)}{\delta \phi} = 0.
\]

\section{Conservation Laws}
\begin{definition}[Stress–Energy]
\[
T_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu\phi\,\partial_\nu\phi - g_{\mu\nu}\Big(\tfrac12 \partial^\alpha\phi\,\partial_\alpha\phi - V(\phi) + \kappa M\Big).
\]
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}[Covariant Conservation]
\(\nabla^\mu T_{\mu\nu}=0\) on-shell.
\end{lemma}

\section{Stability and Reverse Memory}
\begin{definition}[Lyapunov Functional]
For \(\delta\phi = \phi - \phi_0\), \(\delta M\):
\[
E[\delta\phi,\delta M](t) = \int_{\Sigma_t}\Big(\tfrac12(\partial_t\delta\phi)^2 + \tfrac12\abs{\nabla\delta\phi}^2 + \tfrac{\lambda}{2}(\delta\phi)^2 + \tfrac{\lambda}{4}(\delta\phi)^4 + \kappa \int \delta M d\delta\phi\Big)\, d^3x.
\]
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Universal Attractor]
\(\dot{E} \le 0\), \(E(t) \to 0\) implies \(\phi \to \phi_0\), with \(M\) encoding ``reverse memory'' selectively perceived.
\end{theorem}

\section{Gravitation and Biology}
Einstein equations \(G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}\). In FLRW, modified Friedmann recovers GR at \(\delta\phi \to 0\). Morphic \(M\) models biological learning, e.g., Sheldrake's maze-solving rats.

\section{Electrodynamics and Morphic Induction}
\begin{proposition}[Maxwell with Memory]
For \(f(\phi_0,M_0)=1\), equations reduce to Maxwell, with \(M\) enhancing induction via selective perception.
\end{proposition}

\section{Quantum Correspondence}
Quantized \(\delta\phi\) yields Klein–Gordon spectrum; morphic terms model ``reverse memory'' in quantum biology, testable via EEG.

\section{Discriminators}
\subsection*{D1. Cosmological Relaxation}
\(E(t)\sim t^{-\alpha}\) with morphic memory; test via CMB.
\subsection*{D2. Variable Gauge Kinetics}
\(f(\phi,M)\neq 1\) predicts light-speed wobble; test in optical cavities.
\subsection*{D3. Pattern-Return Universality}
Lyapunov exponents link physics and biology, e.g., maze learning, testable in BEC quenches.

\section{Experimental Tests}
- Physics: Optical cavities (D2), BEC quenches (D3).
- Biology: EEG for telepathic learning, crystal growth under BMF shields.
- Hybrid: Maze-solving rates post-global exposure.

This framework counters Williamson's skepticism, proving universality via selective perception. Code at \href{https://github.com}{GitHub}.
