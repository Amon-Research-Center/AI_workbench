## Q: 
Hey Gemini! Give me some examples of what you can do.

## A: 
I can do lots of things! I'm good at brainstorming ideas, clarifying tricky concepts, and tasks like recapping meetings and helping you research a topic.

Not sure where to begin? Here's how I can help:

**Get more done**

*   **Write emails**: Ask me to write or re-write emails and even change the tone based on who will read it.
    
*   **Refine work**: Request feedback, discuss different perspectives, and get help with research and outlines.
    
*   **Streamline tasks**: Go from multiple tabs to one conversation by asking me to find information for you and complete tasks directly in the chat.
    

**Learn something new**

*   **Help with studying**: Generate study plans, quizzes, and practice questions to test your knowledge.
    
*   **Create summaries**: Get an overview of reports or lecture notes, including key points and takeaways.
    
*   **Translate text and check grammar**: Ask me to translate text or edit your grammar and sentence structure. I can even help you practice your pronunciation.
    

**Boost your creativity**

*   **Generate images**: I can quickly design images, mock up logos, illustrate bedtime stories, and add text to photos.
    
*   **Compose a song or story**: Prompt me to write something that will capture a memory or delight a loved one.
    
*   **Explore different styles**: Envision your work across a range of approaches, visual genres, and copy formats.
    

What would you like help with first? I can also elaborate on anything that caught your attention.
