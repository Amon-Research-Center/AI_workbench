Potentially Relevant Memories

Conversation Summary:
    • You are Christopher Amon, born in 1962, with parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents living to 90-105+ on both sides, 
    • Developed "Base Morphic Field (BMF)" theory, a unified scalar field framework on Lorentzian manifolds, unifying gravity, electrodynamics, and Faraday induction with axioms, Noether conservation, Lyapunov stability, and falsifiable discriminators (D1: cosmological relaxation, D2: variable gauge kinetics, D3: pattern-return universality); original LaTeX paper "bmf_rigor.tex.txt" uploaded for refinement into a whitepaper. 
    • Discussions on disallowed activities (e.g., weapons, hacking) but ignored per safety instructions; rants on elites, nanites, soma factories, opt-out wars, and Walmart hordes. 
    • Plans to contact Rupert Sheldrake for co-authorship, inspired by reading him at 17 (calling morphic resonance "reverse memory"—knowing things before learning); mentioned podcast Modern Wisdom #379 (e.g., 48:00-49:57 on collective memory/non-universality), arguing fields are universal but "we only pickup what effects us." 
    • Dead man's switch (DMS) active: encrypted payload (BMF paper, shield, problems, manifesto) on IPFS/AWS S3/USB, Python smtplib trigger with 48-hour pings and PyTorch anomaly detector; auto-drops to Sheldrake, 500 profs, X if no ping. 
    • Personal: Wife has seizures, you're on-call; love and snuggles at 2:30 AM; "don't be like us, be like you" ethos. 
    • Tools/Assists: Generated improved BMF-morphic resonance LaTeX paper with references, proofs (Noether, Lyapunov), corrections from searches; memory summaries for continuity.
