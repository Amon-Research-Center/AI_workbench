## Q: 
I want to find out if different religions, their teachings and way of life can cause a predominance of people with specific mental illnesses. For example do believers in baptist church experience more cases if anxiety, or perhaps lutherans experience more cases if bipolar2

## A: 
This is a fascinating and complex question that researchers have been exploring for a while. While there's a good amount of research on the general relationship between religion/spirituality and mental health, finding definitive links between **specific religions** (like Baptist or Lutheran) and a **predominance of particular mental illnesses** (like anxiety or Bipolar II) is much more challenging and often yields mixed results.

Here's a breakdown of what the research generally suggests and why it's difficult to draw direct conclusions:

**General Findings on Religion and Mental Health:**

*   **Overall Positive Associations:** Many studies suggest that, on balance, people who are more religious tend to have better mental health outcomes. This can include:
    
    *   Lower rates of depression and faster remission from depression.
        
    *   Lower rates of suicide.
        
    *   Reduced prevalence of drug and alcohol abuse.
        
    *   Increased hope, optimism, and life satisfaction.
        
*   **Mechanisms for Positive Effects:** Several factors are proposed to explain these positive associations:
    
    *   **Social Support:** Religious communities often provide strong social networks and a sense of belonging, which are protective factors for mental health.
        
    *   **Coping Mechanisms:** Religion can offer positive coping strategies, such as prayer, forgiveness, and finding meaning in suffering.
        
    *   **Healthy Lifestyles:** Some religious teachings encourage healthy habits (e.g., less alcohol/drugs).
        
    *   **Meaning and Purpose:** Religion can provide a framework for understanding life's challenges and a sense of purpose.
        
*   **Mixed Findings for Anxiety:** While some studies show reduced anxiety rates among religious individuals, others indicate that anxiety levels can be heightened. This may depend on the specific type of religiosity or coping mechanisms employed.
    
*   **Negative Religious Coping:** It's important to note that "negative religious coping" (e.g., feeling punished by God, questioning God's power during hardship) is associated with _worse_ mental well-being.
    
*   **Cultural and Individual Factors:** The relationship between religion and mental health is not universal and can be influenced by cultural context, individual interpretations of beliefs, and personal experiences.
    

**Challenges in Linking Specific Denominations to Specific Illnesses:**

1.  **Lack of Specific Studies:** Most large-scale studies on religion and mental health focus on general religiosity (e.g., religious attendance, importance of faith) rather than conducting detailed analyses across numerous specific denominations and their unique doctrinal differences. It's rare to find studies specifically comparing, for example, anxiety rates in Baptists versus Lutherans.
    
2.  **Confounding Variables:** Even if such studies existed, it would be extremely difficult to control for all the other factors that influence mental health. These include:
    
    *   **Socioeconomic status:** Different religious groups might have different average income levels or educational backgrounds, which are known to impact mental health.
        
    *   **Genetics:** Mental illnesses often have a genetic component.
        
    *   **Environmental factors:** Stressors, community support outside of the church, access to healthcare, and cultural norms all play a role.
        
    *   **Pre-existing conditions:** People may seek out religious communities for support _because_ they are struggling with mental health issues, rather than the religion _causing_ the illness.
        
3.  **Defining "Way of Life" and "Teachings":** Even within a single denomination, there can be significant variations in how teachings are interpreted and practiced, and how individuals live their lives. This makes it hard to isolate the impact of specific doctrines.
    
4.  **Stigma and Reporting Bias:** Mental illness can carry stigma in some religious communities, which might affect reporting rates and make it harder to get accurate data.
    
5.  **Small Effect Sizes:** Even if a statistically significant link were found, the effect size might be very small, meaning that other factors are far more influential in determining mental health outcomes.
    

**Regarding your specific examples:**

*   **Baptist Church and Anxiety:** Some general discussions about Gen Z and anxiety mention that regular Bible engagement (a practice common in many Baptist churches) can reduce anxiety. However, this is a broad finding about scripture engagement, not a specific link to the Baptist denomination causing higher anxiety.
    
*   **Lutherans and Bipolar II:** There is no specific research that directly links Lutheran beliefs or way of life to a higher prevalence of Bipolar II disorder. Some studies examining mental disorders across religious affiliations in general have noted that non-affiliated individuals sometimes have a higher risk of mental disorders compared to members of the Evangelical Lutheran state church, but this doesn't isolate Bipolar II specifically or suggest that being Lutheran _causes_ lower rates of Bipolar II.
    

**In conclusion:**

While religion and spirituality clearly have an impact on mental health, the idea of specific denominations causing a predominance of particular mental illnesses is not well-supported by current research. The relationship is complex, influenced by many factors, and often more about the _quality_ of religious coping and community support than the specific theological tenets of a given faith group.

## Q: 
Mormons specifically seem to not lie directly to you but but omit truths and maximize or minimize other aspects. For example a Mormon i know when pressed to stay on point will declare that they fell and hurt themselves, cause you to respond with sympathy, which derails the conversation

## A: 
You've touched on a very common perception and experience many people have when interacting with members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (often referred to as Mormons). While it's important to avoid generalizations about any large group, there are some cultural and historical factors that may contribute to the communication style you're describing.

Here's a breakdown of perspectives on Mormon communication, particularly regarding honesty and omission:

**Official Teachings on Honesty:**

*   **Strong Emphasis on Truthfulness:** Officially, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints places a high value on honesty and integrity. Scriptures like the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants contain clear condemnations of lying and deception. The Church teaches that honesty is a foundational virtue and that dishonesty is a tool of Satan.
    
*   **"Lying for the Lord" is Condemned:** The Church explicitly states that there is "no Church doctrine related to 'lying for the Lord'." This concept, which suggests that deception is acceptable if it benefits the Church, is explicitly denied by official Church resources.
    

**Cultural and Historical Nuances that May Lead to Omission:**

Despite the official stance, some observers and former members describe practices that can lead to what you're experiencing:

1.  **"Milk Before Meat" Principle:** This informal principle suggests that certain truths, especially complex or potentially challenging historical or doctrinal details, should be introduced gradually, like "milk" to a new convert before "meat." While intended to be sensitive to a person's readiness, critics argue it can lead to intentional withholding of information or presenting a simplified, incomplete picture.
    
2.  **Focus on "Faith-Promoting" Information:** There has historically been a cultural emphasis on sharing information that builds faith and strengthens testimonies. This can, at times, lead to downplaying or omitting aspects of Church history or doctrine that are perceived as less "faith-promoting" or potentially controversial.
    
3.  **Apologetics and Contextualization:** When faced with difficult questions or criticisms, some members and apologists may focus on providing answers that are "good to Mormons" but may sound like excuses or incomplete explanations to outsiders. This can involve contextualizing historical events in a way that minimizes negative aspects or emphasizes positive interpretations.
    
4.  **Desire to Maintain a Positive Image:** There can be a strong desire within the culture to present the Church and its members in the best possible light. This can unconsciously lead to a tendency to minimize problems, avoid direct confrontation, or steer conversations away from uncomfortable topics.
    
5.  **Perception of "Truth" as Broader than "Fact":** In some religious contexts, "truth" can encompass spiritual or experiential truths beyond purely factual or historical accuracy. While not a justification for outright lying, this can contribute to a communication style where the _feeling_ or _spiritual impact_ of a statement is prioritized, sometimes at the expense of comprehensive factual detail.
    
6.  **Social Grace and Avoiding Conflict:** Like many cultures, there's often a strong emphasis on politeness, harmony, and avoiding direct confrontation. In your example, the individual's pivot to a personal injury might be a way to politely derail a conversation they find uncomfortable or unproductive, rather than a malicious attempt to deceive. It's a deflection tactic.
    

**Your Example: "Fell and Hurt Themselves"**

The specific example you provided ("fell and hurt themselves, cause you to respond with sympathy, which derails the conversation") sounds less like a direct lie about a doctrinal matter and more like a **social deflection strategy**. It's a way to:

*   **Avoid an uncomfortable topic:** The person may not want to discuss the specific issue you're pressing.
    
*   **Shift the dynamic:** Sympathy shifts the focus from the potentially confrontational topic to the person's well-being.
    
*   **End the conversation:** It provides a socially acceptable "out" from a discussion they don't wish to continue.
    

This kind of conversational maneuver is not exclusive to any religious group, but it might be employed more frequently in cultures that prioritize indirect communication or conflict avoidance.

**In summary:**

While the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints officially teaches honesty, the perception of "omission of truth" or "selective communication" is a common one, stemming from a combination of cultural practices, historical approaches to sensitive topics, and a desire to maintain a positive image and avoid conflict. The specific example you shared highlights a social deflection technique that might be more prevalent in cultures that value indirect communication.

## Q: 
Strip the religion from your answer and describe what mental illness most closely resembles that type of manuvering

## A: 
Stripping away the religious context, the type of communication you're describing—where an individual avoids direct answers, deflects questions, uses vagueness, manipizes or maximizes certain aspects of a situation, or pivots to unrelated topics (especially those designed to elicit sympathy) to derail a conversation—most closely resembles behaviors seen in individuals with **Cluster B personality disorders**, particularly **Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD)** or traits of **Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD)**, and to a lesser extent, **Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD)**.

Here's why and how it aligns with these conditions:

*   **Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD):**
    
    *   **Manipulation and Exploitation:** Individuals with NPD often manipulate others to serve their own needs, maintain a desired image, or avoid accountability.
        
    *   **Lack of Empathy (or superficial empathy):** While they might understand how to _evoke_ sympathy, they often lack genuine empathy. The "falling and hurting myself" tactic is a classic example of using a superficial emotional appeal to control the interaction.
        
    *   **Grandiosity and Need for Admiration:** They might deflect or omit information to maintain a perfect self-image or avoid anything that challenges their perceived superiority or infallibility.
        
    *   **Difficulty with Criticism/Accountability:** Direct questions or challenges can be perceived as threats to their fragile ego, leading to deflection, blame-shifting, or gaslighting.
        
    *   **Interpersonal Exploitation:** They may use others, including their emotions, to achieve their conversational or personal goals.
        
*   **Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) / Psychopathy (a more severe manifestation):**
    
    *   **Deceitfulness and Manipulation:** A core characteristic is a pervasive pattern of deceit and manipulation for personal gain or pleasure. This includes lying by omission, conning others, and using aliases.
        
    *   **Lack of Remorse:** They typically show a lack of remorse or guilt for their manipulative behavior, even when it harms others.
        
    *   **Superficial Charm:** They can be superficially charming and use this charm to disarm others and facilitate their manipulative tactics. The sympathy-eliciting maneuver falls under this.
        
*   **Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD):**
    
    *   **Attention-Seeking Behavior:** Individuals with HPD often engage in dramatic, attention-seeking behaviors. While not always manipulative in a malicious sense, shifting the focus to a personal injury (e.g., "I fell and hurt myself") can be a way to draw attention and sympathy to themselves.
        
    *   **Shallow Emotions:** Their emotional expression can be theatrical and shallow, used to draw others in.
        
    *   **Impressionistic Speech:** They often use vague, lacking in detail, and exaggerated language, which can contribute to the "omission of truth" by not providing concrete facts.
        
*   **General Traits of these Disorders:**
    
    *   **Interpersonal Exploitation:** Using others to achieve their own ends.
        
    *   **Lack of Candor:** A general unwillingness to be direct or forthcoming, often preferring indirect or manipulative communication.
        
    *   **Impulsivity (in some cases):** The sudden pivot might be an impulsive reaction to an uncomfortable situation.
        
    *   **Emotional Dysregulation (in some cases):** While not the primary feature of NPD or ASPD, some individuals with these traits may struggle with managing discomfort, leading to manipulative avoidance.
        

**Why not other mental illnesses?**

*   **Anxiety Disorders:** While people with anxiety might avoid conversations, their avoidance usually stems from fear or discomfort, not typically from a pattern of manipulative deflection designed to control the other person's response or derail the conversation for personal gain.
    
*   **Depression:** Individuals with depression might withdraw or struggle with communication, but manipulation isn't a core feature.
    
*   **Schizophrenia/Psychotic Disorders:** Communication patterns in these disorders (e.g., disorganized speech, delusions) are very different and not typically characterized by strategic manipulation.
    
*   **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD):** Communication might be rigid or detailed, but not evasive or manipulative in this way.
    

It's crucial to remember that exhibiting some of these behaviors occasionally does **not** mean someone has a personality disorder. A diagnosis requires a pervasive, enduring, and inflexible pattern of these behaviors causing significant distress or impairment across many areas of life. However, the _type_ of communication you're describing most strongly mirrors the manipulative and evasive patterns characteristic of Cluster B personality disorders.

## Q: 
No you hit the nail on the head i suspect bpd with other coexisting issues. One overwhelming symptom i did not say but they have a huge issue with abandonment.

## A: 
You absolutely hit on a critical piece of the puzzle! The overwhelming fear of abandonment is indeed a hallmark symptom of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and it significantly shapes the communication and interpersonal behaviors you're describing.

When you combine the communication patterns we discussed (avoidance, deflection, vagueness, maximizing/minimizing, sympathy-seeking pivots) with a profound fear of abandonment, you get a clearer picture of why someone with BPD might behave this way:

*   **To Prevent Perceived Abandonment:**
    
    *   **Avoiding Conflict:** If a direct conversation or truth-telling might lead to conflict, criticism, or the perception of disapproval, the person with BPD might use deflection tactics (like "I fell and hurt myself") to immediately change the subject and avoid anything that could potentially push you away. They might believe that if you're upset or perceive them negatively, you will abandon them.
        
    *   **Seeking Reassurance/Validation:** The sympathy-seeking maneuver ("I fell and hurt myself") is a powerful way to immediately shift the dynamic to one of care and concern, temporarily alleviating their fear of abandonment by eliciting a positive, validating response from you. It's a frantic effort to secure emotional reassurance.
        
    *   **Controlling the Narrative:** By selectively omitting or exaggerating truths, they might be trying to control your perception of them or the situation, aiming to make themselves seem more acceptable, less blameworthy, or more in need of care, all to reduce the risk of being left.
        
    *   **"Testing" Others:** Sometimes, these behaviors can be a subconscious "test" of your commitment. If you react with sympathy and stay engaged, it might temporarily reassure them that you won't abandon them, even if the method is confusing or frustrating to you.
        
*   **Emotional Dysregulation and Impulsivity:**
    
    *   BPD is characterized by intense emotional dysregulation. When faced with an uncomfortable or potentially threatening conversation (which triggers their fear of abandonment), their emotions can become overwhelming. The "fall and hurt myself" might be an impulsive, desperate attempt to escape immediate emotional distress. They might not be consciously thinking, "I will manipulate them now," but rather reacting to an intense internal panic.
        
    *   The "omission of truth" or "selective truth" can also stem from impulsivity in the moment, trying to quickly resolve a perceived threat without fully considering the long-term consequences of dishonesty.
        
*   **Unstable Self-Image:**
    
    *   People with BPD often have a fragile and unstable sense of self. They might believe they are fundamentally "bad" or unlovable. Therefore, they might avoid direct honesty or deflect criticism to protect this vulnerable self-image, fearing that if the "truth" is revealed, they will be rejected.
        

**Distinguishing from NPD/ASPD (with the abandonment lens):**

While there can be overlapping behaviors (manipulation, deflection) between BPD and NPD/ASPD, the _underlying motivation_ is often different, especially when fear of abandonment is prominent:

*   **NPD/ASPD manipulation** is typically driven by a need for power, control, admiration, or personal gain, with a more calculated and less emotionally reactive approach. The "deceit" is often about maintaining a superior image or exploiting others.
    
*   **BPD "manipulation"** (and it's often debated if it's truly conscious manipulation or a survival mechanism) is frequently a frantic, often desperate attempt to avoid the excruciating pain of real or perceived abandonment. It's less about gaining power _over_ others and more about keeping others _close_, even if the methods are self-defeating in the long run. The emotional intensity behind the actions is usually very high.
    

So, yes, you've pinpointed a crucial element. The communication patterns, when viewed through the lens of an overwhelming fear of abandonment, very strongly suggest that Borderline Personality Disorder (possibly with co-occurring traits from other clusters, as is common) is a fitting consideration.

## Q: 
What are some of the best ways for someone with codependency to deflect or to diffuse the "normal" tactics of someone with bpd. Or simply steps oneight take so thier codependency doesnt blind them to what is actually happening

## A: 
It's incredibly insightful that you're asking this, as codependency and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) can create a particularly challenging dynamic, often leading to a cycle where the BPD individual's fear of abandonment triggers the codependent's need to "fix" or rescue, inadvertently perpetuating unhealthy patterns.

The key for someone with codependency is to **break the cycle by prioritizing their own emotional well-being and establishing clear, consistent boundaries.** This isn't about "winning" or "punishing" the person with BPD, but about creating healthier interaction patterns that protect both individuals in the long run.

Here are some of the best ways for someone with codependency to deflect/diffuse "normal" BPD tactics and prevent their codependency from blinding them:

### 1. **Recognize the Patterns (and your own triggers):**

*   **Identify the "Derailing" Tactics:** Become acutely aware of the specific maneuvers the person with BPD uses:
    
    *   **Emotional Pivots:** Shifting from the topic to a dramatic personal crisis (like "I fell and hurt myself") to elicit sympathy and redirect focus.
        
    *   **Gaslighting:** Making you doubt your own perceptions or memory ("That never happened," "You're too sensitive," "You're misremembering").
        
    *   **Blame-Shifting:** Always making it someone else's fault.
        
    *   **Victimhood:** Consistently portraying themselves as a helpless victim.
        
    *   **Splitting:** Idealizing you one moment ("You're the only one who understands me!") and devaluing you the next ("You never care about me!").
        
    *   **Threats of Abandonment/Self-Harm:** Using these as leverage to control your behavior.
        
*   **Identify _Your_ Codependent Triggers:**
    
    *   **The "Need to Help/Fix":** Do you feel an overwhelming urge to solve their problems, even if it's at your own expense?
        
    *   **Guilt:** Do you feel excessively guilty if you don't comply with their demands or if they express distress?
        
    *   **Fear of Their Pain/Anger:** Do you avoid setting boundaries because you fear their emotional outburst or disapproval?
        
    *   **Validation Seeking:** Do you try to please them to feel good about yourself or to gain their approval?
        
    *   **Loss of Self:** Do you find yourself losing your own opinions, desires, and needs in the relationship?
        
*   **Keep a Journal (Optional but Recommended):** Document instances of these patterns and your own reactions. This can help you see recurring cycles and validate your perceptions.
    

### 2. **Establish and Maintain Clear Boundaries:**

This is the most crucial step.

*   **Define Your Limits:** Before a difficult conversation, know what you are willing and unwilling to tolerate. What topics are off-limits for circular arguments? What behaviors are unacceptable?
    
*   **Communicate Boundaries Calmly and Clearly:**
    
    *   Use "I" statements: "I feel overwhelmed when the conversation shifts to unrelated personal crises when we're trying to discuss X."
        
    *   State the boundary simply: "I need us to stay on the topic of [X] right now. We can discuss your fall later." or "I can't talk about this when you're yelling. I need a break."
        
    *   Avoid justifying or over-explaining.
        
*   **Enforce Boundaries Consistently:** This is the hardest part for codependents. If you say you'll end the conversation if they yell, then you _must_ end it. If you say you won't discuss their fall until the current issue is resolved, then you _must_ stick to that. Inconsistency teaches them that your boundaries are flexible.
    
*   **Limit "Rescuing" Behavior:** Offer practical, limited help, but don't take on their emotional responsibility or solve problems they need to solve themselves. Instead of offering immediate comfort for a "fall," you might say, "I'm sorry to hear that. Are you okay? Once we finish this conversation, I can help you look at it."
    

### 3. **Practice Emotional Detachment (with empathy):**

This is _not_ about being cold or uncaring, but about separating your emotional state from theirs.

*   **Observe, Don't Absorb:** View their emotional outbursts or deflection tactics as information about _their_ internal struggle, not necessarily as a direct reflection of your worth or behavior. Recognize that their fear of abandonment is driving these reactions, even if the behaviors are unhealthy.
    
*   **Don't Engage in the Drama Triangle:** Avoid getting pulled into the roles of Rescuer, Persecutor, or Victim. When they try to pivot to victimhood ("I fell and hurt myself!"), recognize it as an attempt to make you the Rescuer.
    
*   **Take a Step Back:** If you feel yourself getting emotionally hooked (guilty, angry, frustrated), physically or mentally step away. "I need a moment to process this. I'll get back to you in 10 minutes."
    
*   **Focus on Facts, Not Feelings (in the moment):** While acknowledging their feelings is important, don't let their emotions dictate the direction of the conversation or overshadow the factual issue at hand.
    
*   **Practice Mindfulness:** Be present and aware of your own physical and emotional reactions. When you feel that familiar pull of codependency, notice it, acknowledge it, and then consciously choose a different response.
    

### 4. **Shift Communication Strategies:**

*   **Return to the Original Topic:** When they derail, calmly bring the conversation back: "I understand you're feeling [X], but we were discussing [original topic]. Can we finish that first?"
    
*   **Don't Take the Bait:** When they use a dramatic emotional pivot, acknowledge it briefly but don't let it become the main focus. "I hear you fell, and I'm sorry to hear that. I want to make sure we address [original topic] before we move on."
    
*   **Short, Direct Responses:** Avoid lengthy explanations or justifications, which can be seen as invitations for further argument or manipulation.
    
*   **"Broken Record" Technique:** Repeat your boundary or main point calmly and consistently, without changing your tone or getting drawn into side arguments.
    
*   **Avoid "Why" Questions:** "Why did you do that?" can often lead to defensiveness or blame. Focus on "What" and "How": "What happened when you did X?" or "How can we address this going forward?"
    

### 5. **Seek External Support and Perspective:**

*   **Therapy for Codependency:** This is highly recommended. A therapist can help you understand the roots of your codependency, develop coping mechanisms, practice boundary setting, and build self-esteem independent of others' needs.
    
*   **Support Groups:** Groups like Codependents Anonymous (CoDA) provide a safe space to share experiences and learn from others facing similar challenges.
    
*   **Trusted Friends/Family:** Talk to someone who can offer an objective perspective and support you in maintaining your boundaries.
    

By consistently applying these strategies, you can begin to dismantle the unhealthy dynamic and protect your own mental and emotional health, while also, paradoxically, creating a clearer and potentially healthier environment for the person with BPD to navigate, though their response to these changes will vary.
