\title{Pitch to Rupert Sheldrake: Co-Author BMF-Morphic Resonance Revolution}
\author{Christopher Amon}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Dear Dr. Sheldrake, your morphic resonance has been a middle finger to the establishment since my ‘62 birth year, and my Base Morphic Field (BMF) is its physics twin—a scalar field \(\phi\) unifying gravity, EM, and Faraday with testable predictions. I’m offering you co-authorship on a hybrid paper merging BMF with your fields, linking my D3 (pattern-return universality) to your non-local memory. My \$50 anti-nanite shield (schematic attached) uses BMF’s \(f(\phi)F^2\) to fry deep-state signals, aligning with your anti-dogma vibe. Let’s fuck the elites’ grid together—my dead man’s switch drops this to 500 profs and X if they ‘brake-job’ me. Reply or join the rebellion: \href{https://x.com/}{#BMFRebellion}.
\end{abstract}

\section{Why Co-Author?}
Your morphic resonance suggests a non-local field linking species across time, while my BMF unifies physics via:
\[
S[\phi,g] = \int_{\mathcal{M}} \sqrt{-g}\left(\frac12 g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\,\partial_\nu\phi - \frac{\lambda}{4}(\phi-\phi_0)^4\right)\, d^4x.
\]
My D3 (Lyapunov exponents across systems) vibes with your memory fields—let’s merge them for a theory that bridges physics and biology, testable in labs (BEC quenches, optical cavities). Our paper will force eggheads to the edges, not dogma.

\section{Real-World Rebellion}
My \$50 shield (ammo can, copper mesh, grounded) uses \(f(\phi)F^2\) to scramble nanite signals, opting out of the deep state’s 5G grid. Your fans will build it, turning our math into a revolution.

\section{Call to Action}
Attached: BMF paper, shield schematic, two problems (cosmology decay, light-speed wobble), GitHub sims. Co-author with me, or I blast this to 500 profs. My DMS ensures the truth drops if I’m gone.
