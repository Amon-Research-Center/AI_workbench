Roger Penrose in his 1989 book, The Emperor's New Mind, argued that no machine could replicate human consciousness. This view runs counter to the ordinary beliefs at the time. Marvin Minsky, who many figures regard as the father of artificial intelligence, claimed that the brain is just a computer made of meat. What Penrose described was that it's not about how complex these machines are or how fast they are, but rather that they were fundamentally limited by algorithmic logic. And that is something that human thought appears to bypass. And so in order to fully explain this, Roger Penrose turned to quantum physics. He proposed that consciousness might arise from non-deterministic quantum level processes, the kind of computation that goes beyond neural architectures. It wasn't long until Penrose collaborated with Stuart Hamoth. He introduced the idea that quantum coherence might occur inside the brain's microtubules. This is cylindrical protein structures within neurons. Their purpose is to regulate the shape and division of cells. But in this context, Hammer believed they might also serve as biological quantum devices, the perfect candidates for sustaining quantum coherence. So together, Penrose and Hamarof proposed the orchestrated objective reduction theory. According to this, consciousness arises from orchestrated collapses of quantum states within these microtubules. Each collapse or reduction is not just a physical event but a discrete moment of conscious experience and they are internally driven by thresholds of gravitational self energy.That's what the brain does. That's what the microtubules do. Orchestrates the objective reduction. Hence the theory is orchestrated objective reduction.

Physicist Max Tegmark dismissed this idea on physical grounds. He argued that" "quantum coherence in a biological environment like the brain would decoher in less than 10 theus3 seconds far too quickly to have any cognitive relevance. Tegmark's conclusion was that if the brain were using quantum processes, we'd need to be thinking 10 trillion thoughts per second for it to matter. But despite this, in 2013, experimental results from a Japanese team detected vibrations in microtubules. If quantum activity could persist in microtubules for longer durations, then the biological conditions for Roger's theory might be plausible after all." "This concept also touches on the debate around free will.

Classical neuroscience suggests determinism that all thoughts" "and decisions are caused by prior brain states. Roger Penrose challenges this claim. He argues that quantum" "indeterminacy could introduce genuine unpredictability into neural processes" "and disrupt strict causal chains, not through randomness, but through non-computable structure. This would" "create space for choices that are neither deterministic nor algorithmic."

Well, the bigger consequence of this idea is that consciousness is not merely a byproduct" "of physical law. It may be fundamental to the existence of the universe itself.

In Roger Penrose's words, somehow our" "consciousness is the reason the universe is here. It's almost the same message as Don Hoffman who also thought that what" "is fundamental is consciousness. Although his idea is a little bit different in terms of how he explains" "the link to the physical world.

My assumption is that the fundamental reality is just consciousness. When we" "have different for example spaces and times, one organism has 10 dimensions of color perception. Another one has four," "we have three. Some organisms see in four dimensions or two dimensions. If consciousness depends on quantum laws" "and quantum behavior follows mathematical structure, then awareness itself may be grounded in mathematics." "So if that's the case, then mathematics is not just a language we use to describe the universe. It may be the" "operating system the universe runs on. And what if we extend this thought process even further? What if there's an" "idea that describes not only that mathematics is the operating system, but that the very fact that our universe is" "mathematical?

"Physicist Eugene Whimmer once published an article, the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the" "natural sciences. The statement pointed to a genuine epistemological puzzle. Why" "is it that equations invented by humans to solve local problems end up predicting phenomena far outside their" "original domain? This question is really the core hypothesis of Max Tegmark. He" "proposes what he calls the mathematical universe hypothesis. The idea that the universe is mathematics not merely" "described by math but made of it. In his view, every structure that exists physically corresponds to a mathematical" "structure. I mean in plain English that our universe doesn't just have some mathematical properties, but that it" "fundamentally has only mathematical properties. And this is the reason for the bit we" "showcased at the beginning of this video. A prime number remains prime whether observed by a human, an alien or" "an algorithm. Because math at its core does not depend on language or culture." "If it can be defined by relations, symmetries and axioms, then it is a candidate for physical existence. And so" "this view extends the legacy of Plato's mathematical realism. The mathematical forms in Plato's ontology like perfect" "circles, numbers, geometric solids exist in a timeless and non-physical realm." "They are not invented but discovered by conscious beings.

What Max Tegmark hypothesizes is something more radical" "that the Platonic realm and physical reality are the same thing. Our universe is not embedded in math. It is math." "The reason math has been so effective in describing the world is that the world is mathematical, completely" "mathematical. We actually inhabit a mathematical structure. The approximations we've found so far are" "just some simpler math approximating, you know, the actual math. And so" "constants of nature like the fine structure constant, gravitational or planks constant are not set by anything." "They are intrinsic properties of the mathematical structure we happen to inhabit. And what we call physical laws" "are just features of that structure.

But remember, it's only the reality we" "inhabit, not anywhere else. Only the spacetime we know and love. And so if" "there's another structure or reality out there, this might not be the case. The Galileo experiment we showcased earlier" "might not yield the same relationship. Perhaps it could be another variable that is not time squared. Or the prime" "number would be another concept entirely. And all of this subset of mathematical structures would be" "classified into the level four multiverse by Max Tegmark where it encompasses every single one of these" "subsets. And our reality now is just one point in an infinite mathematical" "landscape

. So if Tegmark is correct, then consciousness, particles, spaceime," "and all physical phenomena are emergent aspects of the underlying math. The" "brain is a mathematical object. The observer is a mathematical process and existence itself is formal, not" "material. It's a position that pushes the boundary of what science can empirically address. that maybe the" "simplest explanation is that our physical reality is mathematics in motion.
