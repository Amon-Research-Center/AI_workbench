## Q: 
I was listening to the comedies manufacturer festo what is bourgeoisie

## A: 
It sounds like you might have misheard "Festo" in the context of "comedies manufacturer." Festo is actually a well-known **German industrial control and automation company**. They produce things like pneumatic and electric automation technology, and are also a global leader in technical training and education. They are not known for manufacturing comedies!

Perhaps you heard something that sounded similar, or it was used in a metaphorical sense.

Now, regarding your question about the **bourgeoisie**:

The term "bourgeoisie" has evolved over time, but in its most common usage, especially in the context of social and political theory (particularly Marxism), it refers to:

*   **The social class that owns the means of production:** This includes things like factories, land, capital, and other resources necessary for producing goods and services.
    
*   **The capitalist class:** They derive their wealth and power from this ownership and from the profits generated by the labor of others.
    
*   **A historical context:** The term originated in medieval France to describe inhabitants of walled towns (bourgs) who were merchants, artisans, and professionals – essentially a "middle class" that emerged between the peasantry and the aristocracy.
    
*   **In Marxist theory:** Karl Marx viewed the bourgeoisie as the ruling class in capitalist societies. He argued that they exploit the proletariat (the working class) by paying them less than the value of their labor, leading to class conflict.
    

In more general or contemporary usage, "bourgeoisie" can sometimes simply refer to the **middle class or upper-middle class**, often with connotations of conventional tastes, materialism, and a concern for social respectability. However, the more precise and historically significant definition is tied to the ownership of the means of production.

## Q: 
I was listening to the Communist Manifesto and I want to know what the bourgeoisie is and what the proletariat is

## A: 
You're delving into the core of Marx and Engels' argument in _The Communist Manifesto_! Understanding the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is essential to grasping their view of history and the future of society.

Here's a breakdown of both terms as they are used in the _Manifesto_:

### The Bourgeoisie

In _The Communist Manifesto_, the **bourgeoisie** refers to:

*   **The Capitalist Class:** This is the ruling class in a capitalist society. They are the owners of the "means of production."
    
*   **Owners of the Means of Production:** This is the crucial defining characteristic. "Means of production" include:
    
    *   Factories
        
    *   Land
        
    *   Machinery
        
    *   Raw materials
        
    *   Capital (money used to invest in production)
        
    *   Essentially, anything required to produce goods and services, **except** for human labor.
        
*   **Employers of Wage Labor:** The bourgeoisie hires the proletariat to work their means of production. Their wealth and power come from the profits generated by this wage labor.
    
*   **Historically Revolutionary, Now Oppressive:** Marx and Engels acknowledge that the bourgeoisie played a revolutionary role in overthrowing feudalism and developing new, more productive economic systems. However, they argue that this class has now become an oppressive force, maintaining its power through the exploitation of the working class.
    
*   **Driven by Profit and Accumulation:** The primary goal of the bourgeoisie is to constantly expand capital and maximize profits. This drives innovation and global expansion, but also leads to increasing exploitation and class conflict.
    

**In essence, the bourgeoisie are the capitalists, the wealthy business owners, and those who control the economic resources and enterprises.**

### The Proletariat

In contrast, the **proletariat** refers to:

*   **The Working Class:** This is the social class that does _not_ own the means of production.
    
*   **Sellers of Their Labor Power:** Their only means of survival is to sell their ability to work (their "labor power") to the bourgeoisie for wages.
    
*   **Exploited by the Bourgeoisie:** Marx and Engels argue that the proletariat is exploited because the value they create through their labor is greater than the wages they receive. The surplus value goes to the bourgeoisie as profit.
    
*   **Propertyless:** Unlike the bourgeoisie, the proletariat owns little to no property of significant economic value. They are dependent on the capitalist system for employment.
    
*   **Revolutionary Class:** Marx and Engels see the proletariat as the truly revolutionary class. They believe that as capitalism develops, the conditions of the proletariat will worsen, leading to increased class consciousness and ultimately, a revolution to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a classless, communist society.
    
*   **United by Common Suffering:** Despite initial divisions (e.g., by competition for jobs), the shared experience of exploitation and alienation under capitalism leads to the proletariat uniting and forming a powerful collective force.
    

**In essence, the proletariat are the wage-earners, the workers, who must sell their labor to survive.**

### The Core Conflict

_The Communist Manifesto_ posits that the entire history of society is a history of class struggles. In modern capitalist society, this struggle is simplified into a direct antagonism between these two main classes: the **bourgeoisie** (the oppressors) and the **proletariat** (the oppressed). Marx and Engels argue that this inherent conflict will inevitably lead to the downfall of capitalism and the triumph of the proletariat.
