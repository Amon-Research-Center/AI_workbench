Dear Dr. Sheldrake,

It is with profound respect that I share with you “The Base Morphogenic Field”, a framework born in part from Alan Turing's work "Chemical basis of Morphogenesis". Your work in this field allowed me see past the rigid confines of cellar morphogenesis. My thinking was freed to ask the question; how far does or can this field penetrate. Where does it stop and the more troubling query is, where does it begin.

My work emerged not in rebellion, but in symbiosis. I knew that in order for morphogenic resonance to mature that it needed Alan's math underpinning it. To complete,to give mathematical clarity, simulation pathways, and a structured platform for further exploration, without it it couldn't would not emerge. I believed in the importance and universality of morphogenesis from reading your works. Yet I struggled to find a way back to Alan's equations. After watching "" I was encouraged to go back and read Alan's work yet again (I think that was the 34th time). I found what I was looking for a seemingly innocuous statement:
    "The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that
    certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many
    of the facts."

The idea formed that is it possible that nothing is hidden,everything we need to know is available to us, if it were only perceived correctly. It sent me looking for beginnings, peeling away, like an onion, layer upon layer, until I was left with, well with ..   What I present to you in honor of your years and your sacrifices the Amon-Turing Field Theory.  You continue to stay your course under pressure holding to the beliefs you know to be true and I know what difficulties I have these next few years. They will be a great challenge to me and your example will always help me in dark time. I can not thank you more then to offer my life's work, this is why I exist. Please don't let that stop you from ripping it to shreds and sending it back to me as confetti. But I think it will withstand the hardiest of assaults.

I ask one thing of you sir, please keep this in confidence, I have yet to formalize or put in place the safeguards needed so that it will not be used in the most despicable of ways.

The thesis is yours to critique first, if you care to; your vision and daring opened in me the courage to reach out and touch truth.

May the ideas within these pages stand as both homage and invitation for all to gaze further into the elegant and beautiful coherence that is our universe.

Thank you for lighting the flame. It was out there in the field and it's time had come, so it has arrived.

Warm regards,
Christopher Amon
