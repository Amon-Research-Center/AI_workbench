 Teaspoon, 1900 - 1960

 Scope and Contents

 The spoon is held with a label by Mrs Turing: 'This is the spoon which I found in Alan Turing's
 laboratory. It is similar to the one which he gold-plated himself. It seems quite probable he was
 intending to gold-plate this one using cyanide of potassium of his own manufacture. E. Sara
 Turing.' The verdict of the inquest on AMT was suicide. Mrs Turing never accepted this,
 believing that his death was an accidental consequence of scientific experiments carelessly
 conducted.
