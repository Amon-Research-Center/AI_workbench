## 1. BMF Lagrangian from Jupyter Notebook

**Source**: `/home/nfs/wip/lagrangian.ipynb`

**The BMF Lagrangian**:
```latex
\mathcal{L}[\Psi] = \frac{1}{2}(\partial_t \Psi)^2 - \frac{c^2}{2}\|\nabla \Psi\|^2 + S\,\Psi
```

**With Rayleigh Dissipation**:
```latex
\mathcal{R} = \frac{k}{2}(\partial_t \Psi)^2
```

**Resulting Field Equation**:
```latex
\partial_t^2 \Psi = c^2 \nabla^2 \Psi - k \partial_t \Psi + S
```

## 2. Morphic Field Action Principle from Godprint Dissertation

**Source**: `/home/nfs/ek_data/curation/Godprint Morphic Field Dissertation.txt`

**Complete Action Formulation**:
```latex
S[\phi] = \int_M d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \partial_\mu\phi \partial^\mu\phi - \frac{\lambda}{4}(\phi - \phi_0)^4 \right]
```

**Euler-Lagrange Equation**:
Variation yields the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation:
```latex
\Box \phi + \lambda(\phi - \phi_0)^3 = 0
```

**Stability Analysis**:
- Quartic potential with single global minimum at φ₀
- Lyapunov function proves global attractor behavior
- All perturbations return to base morphic field

## 3. Turing's 1951 Mathematical Fragment

**Source**: `/home/nfs/ek_data/curation/deepseek_latex_20250811_5e3867.tex`

**Turing's Morphogenic Force**:
```latex
\vec{\mathcal{F}} = \underbrace{\kappa \nabla^2 \Psi}_{\text{curvature}} + \underbrace{\mu \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t}}_{\text{dynamics}} + \underbrace{\nu \delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0)}_{\text{localization}}
```

**Historical Connection**: This shows the mathematical lineage from Turing's 1951 work through to Christopher's five operators.

**Source**: `/home/nfs/ek_data/curation/gpt-4o` (Mini Dissertation)

**The Complete Academic Formulation**:

### Master Equation:
```latex

```

**Movement Operator**:
```latex
\hat{M}\Psi = -i\hbar\nabla\Psi

- **Heisenberg Uncertainty**: Δx·Δp ≥ ℏ/2 via Cauchy-Schwarz
- **Consciousness**: Self-referential field loops
- **Life**: Self-maintaining BMF patterns

## 5. Gravitational Coupling

**Einstein Field Equations with BMF**:
```latex
G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}[\phi]
```

**Energy-Momentum Tensor**:
```latex
T_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\mu\phi \partial_\nu\phi - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}\left(\partial_\alpha\phi \partial^\alpha\phi + V(\phi)\right)
```

**Cosmological Applications**:
- Dark energy as BMF misalignment
- Universe evolution from φ₀ ground state
- Experimental predictions via condensed matter analogs
