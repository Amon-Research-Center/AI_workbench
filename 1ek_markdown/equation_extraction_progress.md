# Equation Extraction Progress
*Building the canonical 25 equations with integrated prose*

## Extraction Strategy
**Not just the math** - Extract equations **WITH their context**:
- What led to each equation
- Christopher's reasoning and insights  
- How it connects to the broader theory
- Why it matters for the framework

## Sources Being Processed
1. **deepseek1** - First mathematical formalization
2. **DS_Two** - Turing integration mathematics
3. **deepseek_latex_20250811_5e3867.tex** - LaTeX formalization
4. **amon_field_whitepaper.md** - Academic presentation
5. **bmf_theory_improved (1).md** - Enhanced version
6. **Scattered transcript fragments** - Equation development moments

## Format for Integration
For each equation:
```
### Equation N: [Descriptive Name]

**Context**: [Christopher's insight that led to this]

**Mathematical Form**:
```latex
[Equation in LaTeX]
```

**Meaning**: [What this equation represents in plain language]

**Connection**: [How this relates to other equations and the broader theory]

**Derivation**: [Key steps if available]
```
