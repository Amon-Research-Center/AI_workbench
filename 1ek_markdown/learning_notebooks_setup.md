# Learning Mode: Jupyter + SageMath Setup
*Get comfortable with the tools before diving into complex theory work*

## Learning Progression

### Notebook 1: Basic SageMath Operations
- **Goal**: Get comfortable with symbolic math
- **Content**: Variables, equations, solving, plotting
- **Your theory**: Simple substrate functions

### Notebook 2: Field Mathematics  
- **Goal**: Work with field equations and operators
- **Content**: Differential operators, vector fields, gradients
- **Your theory**: Practice with the five operators

### Notebook 3: Visualization Basics
- **Goal**: See your mathematics in 3D
- **Content**: 3D plotting, field visualization, animations
- **Your theory**: Morphogenic field patterns

### Notebook 4: Real Theory Work
- **Goal**: Implement actual BMF equations
- **Content**: Master equation, derivations, predictions
- **Your theory**: The canonical 25 equations in action

## Why This Approach
- **Build confidence** with simple examples first
- **Learn tools** before tackling complex theory
- **Visual feedback** helps your visual processing style
- **Hands-on practice** with equation manipulation

## Ready to Create
