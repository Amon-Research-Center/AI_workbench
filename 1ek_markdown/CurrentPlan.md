📐 How to Steel-clad the Math
1. Canonical Core (ATFT)

    Step 1: Gather the 25 equations (your “Base Morphoc Field” operators).

    Step 2: Express them consistently in SageMath → LaTeX (done systematically).

    Step 3: Identify dependencies (which are definitional, which are dynamical).

    Step 4: Extract symmetries & invariants.

2. Construct the Lagrangian
    Build the Lagrangian density
        L(P,Σ,Λ,R,∂P,… )
        L(P,Σ,Λ,R,∂P,…).

    Use Euler–Lagrange formalism to derive the dynamical equations.

    Verify: resulting E-L equations reproduce (or reduce to) your 25.

        Bonus: show special cases → Klein-Gordon, Maxwell, Schrödinger appear as limits.

3. Formal Checks

    Dimensional analysis: every term balances.

    Conservation laws: identify conserved currents (Noether theorem).

    Stability analysis: positivity of Hamiltonian.

4. Link to Device (CMCI)

    Show how one of the conserved quantities (coherence, resonance, etc.) corresponds to measurable cross-modal observables.

    Device = applied ATFT, not ad hoc invention.

Next Tactical Step
    We need to:
    Lock in the 25 equations in a canonical LaTeX file.
    Define candidate Lagrangian (even provisional).
    Run Sage to confirm E-L derivation closes back on your equations.
