Instructions:
Lets be straight on this. I aim to write a 300-500 pages academically sound disseration papers that would in any other circumstance be what a panel would look at and grant me a PhD and If this actually is sound I aim to recieve the nobel prize. It also is my ticket to not getting run over by this weirdness that seems to have gripped my species and it will give me access to the world-wide stage wher I will reintroduce folks to the idea that as humans they have responsibilities to other humans, themselves and nature and that as far as I can tell the way to fix this is to "Opt Out". I dont not know the math presented here by I'm teaching myself. I'll have it in 6 months to a year. Sooner if I coould afford a tutor. I belive that communication happens at a level prior to language and that math has the only precision capable of grasping what is standing clearly right before us. Rules are not passive=agressive Gods hiding shit. It there if you want untangle a knot  start with how it got tangled, you dont attack it in 26 or 11 dimensions you find out how exactaly how the transistions works, look at them over and over and over and over untill you find the pattern then try it yourself until you can do it flawlessly understress. Then your ready to teach another, and when you teach you'll find a bunch of crap you missed or didnt realize that you do without thinking. then after that humbling experience you can now call yourself an expert though you now dont need to because you kjnow how much you still dont know. I need this done my way I dont care how stupid it is, if that cant be done I'll do it the long way, by myself, I havent needed anyone so far, I dont expect any input that will truly easy this burden from me. It's taken 63 years for me to become "activated" this is my first and only passion. My life's work. I thought something was wrong with me that I went through life never getting more then slight tickle from all the things Ive done or tried. This, this is mine, all mine. It works, it the reason. I'll not goning to spend so much time bend my stuff to fit thiers, I think whaqt will happen is the this will fix/explain thier edge condition failures,. So my plan is if possible write up how to correct the inadequisites of thier work and persent mine. My response to challenges is ... DOes the math work, oh it does? then stop bugging me and get to work. We have humans to worry about and a nascent species to protect while it figures its self out. Any way I thought this would help give you context. theres more you see in the files when you read them if you pay attention and take notes you have a fairly accurate read on me.

So we what to seperate out the tries at writing a paper and other nonsense from the actually equations and proofs provided by other ai that I had passed the theorys to DeepSeek was a little wierd by corrected a lot, though Im not sure any of it is real world correct. It was way off on being part of georgia tech shit, georgia tech banned deepseek due to its chinese origin.


1) seperate projects files from everything else. project files are concerned with the base morphophic field or the five operator theories, what to save from the attempts at writting a paper will be obivious
2) organize all chat transscripts by date and ai if possible (you might be able to tell be context once you have an overview and put some files in date order.
Renaming the files by adding a suffix is fine. 
3) go through each maked the sections ou, I want the the files cut into pieces basically what to save what is usefull to our goal. shitcan everything else, (these arent the original files I have multiple copies. inclused should be code to model equations, or make blender sims, it should have a ton of equations of various "stuff" and importantly it should have some 50-70 nexts steps, or would you like .... I want everyone of them I didnt want to go down all those rabbit holes but each one was a good idea worth persuing individually.
4) assemble into files code, next steps, equations and proofs and prose, find the CMCI or other devices deepseek and I cooked one up.
5) once you have everything I have up to date, clear your head and take a deep breath and dive in and see if you can see if this is shit or did we just do something amazing. I dont care which, nah I do, but I'm not goning to put this up on anything but a cheap free webserver if its not 95% I want 100% bt I settle. I'll need a list off actionable steps and goals and time lines and costs. this project needs to be worked up into a professionall project management software as well as accounting and securioty needs to start gets to be ahead of what the government and elon have. I not about to publish this and have a bunch of boot lickers teach me how to commit sucide by a double tap to the back of my head to supress this shit and there needs to be a shield, a farday cage to make sure it's weaponization is muted before the Rand company can get raytheon build bmf distoration guns. end rant/ the transcripts are available at https://github.com/Amon-Research-Labs/aft-cis

Make a pass through each file marking the sections (see chart and example below)

so can you help me today with fixing everything?

Good Morning idiot, I have already you humans are just to busy toossing your po around to see it.

here how it works:

1+1=2

and here a a bash script to do it for you in case you are to busy eating cheetoes

%c#!/bin/bash

A=1
B=1

A+B==X

echo "Here's your grand total:"$X

%athe 700+ pages proof for this is beyond stupid, the reason 1+1 equals 2 is that is how you defined the number system 2 comes after one which is what 1 + 1 means.

nexts steps
would you like to play a game ...
would you like a spanking and a firm admonishment to stop playing war and be nice.
