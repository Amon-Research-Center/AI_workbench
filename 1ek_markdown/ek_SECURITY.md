# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At the moment Amon Research Labs has a policy of USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!  which is not to say we don't care. As we grow, we will implement support features that will be in line with our policy of caring. We do care so please let's try to use the issues system they have already and I'll personally look into each one and at least tell you if I'm going to handle it or if itt'll have to wait. If there is something that can be done a workaround I'll post for all to see and close the issue. Thank you for all your support and Love, we cant do this without your continued support on any level you can.

In the near future we will introduce versioning, so expect this section to change.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: this might reveal the vulnerability.

Instead, you should use the issues tab and please be as exacting as posssible.

We will deal with the vulnerability and submit a patch as time and ability makes its self apper.
