# RED PRIORITY: Lock in the 25 Equations
**The ONE thing that enables everything else**

## Why This is THE Priority
- **Blocks everything else** - Can't publish, patent, or build without solid math foundation
- **Mentioned repeatedly** - AI systems consistently identified this as critical gap
- **Christopher's foundation** - Your insights need rigorous mathematical expression
- **Enables all applications** - CMCI, shields, abundance tech all depend on this

## What Needs to Happen
1. **Gather all equation fragments** from transcripts and files
2. **Standardize notation** - Consistent LaTeX formatting
3. **Verify completeness** - All 25 equations identified and documented
4. **Dimensional analysis** - Ensure all terms balance
5. **Lock in canonical file** - One authoritative mathematical foundation

## Current Status
- Equations scattered across multiple transcript files
- DeepSeek sessions contain mathematical formalization
- Need systematic extraction and organization
- Foundation exists, needs consolidation

## Success Criteria  
✅ **One canonical LaTeX file** with all 25 equations  
✅ **Consistent notation** throughout  
✅ **Dimensional verification** complete  
✅ **Ready for Lagrangian derivation** and all downstream work
