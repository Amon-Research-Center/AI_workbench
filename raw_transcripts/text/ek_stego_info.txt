🧠 How to Use

Place your base wallpaper image as wallpaper.jpg in the same directory.

Run the script:

chmod +x stegovault.sh

# Create the hidden vault inside the image
./stegovault.sh create

# Mount it later
./stegovault.sh mount

# Unmount when done
./stegovault.sh unmount


Your encrypted container will now be stored in vault_hidden.jpg, which looks like a normal image.

Let me know if you want this to work with random wallpaper selection or integrate with cron or feh.

i'll just need to hack the files attributes to look like the rest of the files

Exactly — to make your vault_hidden.jpg blend in with other wallpapers, you'll want to match file metadata and attributes like:

Timestamps (created, modified, accessed)

Permissions and ownership

Size and format

File attributes (e.g., chattr on Linux)

🧰 Here's How to "Hack" the Attributes:
🕒 1. Match Timestamps
# Use a real wallpaper file to copy timestamps
touch -r reference.jpg vault_hidden.jpg

🔐 2. Match Permissions
# Assuming wallpapers are readable by all
chmod 644 vault_hidden.jpg
chown youruser:yourgroup vault_hidden.jpg

🧱 3. Set Immutable Flag (optional)

To make it harder to modify or delete:

sudo chattr +i vault_hidden.jpg


⚠️ You’ll need to chattr -i it again before modifying or replacing the file.

🪞 4. File Format Mimicry

Appending binary data won’t change how most image viewers see the file, but if you're paranoid:

Use exiftool to clone metadata:

exiftool -tagsFromFile reference.jpg vault_hidden.jpg


Would you like to integrate this auto-camouflage into your stegovault.sh script?

yes that would help, can i change the size or is that going to stick out

Great question.

🔍 Can You Change the Size?

Yes, but only within reason — the total size of your vault_hidden.jpg will be:

original image size + encrypted container size


So if your original image is 2 MB and you append a 100 MB container, it becomes ~102 MB, which will stand out in a typical wallpaper folder where most files are 1–5 MB.

🧨 Solutions to Hide the Size Difference:
✅ Option 1: Use a High-Res Image as Base

Use a wallpaper that’s already large — like a 4K image (~15–20 MB), then only append a small container (e.g., 10–20 MB).

✅ Option 2: Pad Other Images

Pad a few other images to similar sizes with dd to fake uniformity:

dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=10 >> other_image.jpg

✅ Option 3: Store Vaults in Several Images (Sharded)

Split the vault across multiple images (advanced, can script).

✅ Updated Stego Script with Camouflage

I’ll now add:

touch -r for timestamp copying

chmod and chown matching

Optional chattr +i for stealth

Give me one moment to generate the new script.
