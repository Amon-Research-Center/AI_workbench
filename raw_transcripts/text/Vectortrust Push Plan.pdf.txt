           ◦ README
           ◦ Seedpack
           ◦ Transcripts (YAML)
           ◦ Checksums
           ◦ Peer review prompt

    3. Final Polish + Pause

    6. 6a. If the math fails:
            ◦ Pivot to related research path.
            ◦ Seek alternative formulations.
            ◦ Still contact Sam Altman—need remains.
    7. 6b. If the math holds:
            ◦ Immediate full publication.
