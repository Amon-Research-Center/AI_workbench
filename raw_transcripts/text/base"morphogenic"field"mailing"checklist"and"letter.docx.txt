Cover Letter to Dr. Rupert Sheldrake

July 9, 2025
Dr. Rupert Sheldrake
20 Willow Road
London NW3 1TJ
United Kingdom
Dear Dr. Sheldrake,
It is with deep respect and gratitude that I share with you a work
titled "The Base Morphogenic Field."
This framework, born from contemplation and sincere exploration, builds
upon the lineage you helped establish with morphic resonance. It is not
meant to compete or correct, but to complete—a next step, mathematically
and experimentally grounded, in honoring the question you so boldly
asked.
I offer this manuscript for your consideration—not to seek validation,
but as a bow across time. You held the thread. This is what it pulled
forth.
With respect and kinship,
Christopher Amon
(Concept Originator)
