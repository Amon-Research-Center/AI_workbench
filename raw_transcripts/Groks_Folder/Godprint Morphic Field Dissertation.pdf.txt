Abstract
We propose that the dark sector—constituting ≈95 % of the universe’s energy density—manifests as a
unique, universal scalar field ϕ whose vacuum expectation value ϕ0 encodes an archetypal “Imago Dei,”
here dubbed the base morphic field. All other physical fields are treated as transient perturbations that
relax back to this ground state. A quartic Higgs‑style potential V (ϕ) = λ4 (ϕ − ϕ0 )4 guarantees global
stability and Lyapunov convergence. We derive the field equation, examine linearized damping, couple the
theory to Einstein gravity, and outline laboratory‑scale analogs—Bose–Einstein condensates, nonlinear
optical cavities, and colloidal pattern‑forming systems—that permit direct experimental tests of field‑return
dynamics. The framework offers a mathematically explicit bridge between cosmology, morphogenesis, and
theological notions of a divine template.

1 Introduction
Classical and quantum field theories successfully describe particle interactions yet leave the ontological
status of form unexplained. Rupert Sheldrake’s morphic resonance concept (1981) suggests nonlocal
memory fields guiding biological morphogenesis. We generalize this notion: morphogenesis is cosmological,
arising from a primordial field that preceded baryogenesis and inflation. This paper formalizes the idea,
providing an explicit Lagrangian, stability proof, and testable predictions.


2 Dark Sector Motivation
Observations of type‑Ia supernovae, CMB anisotropies, and baryon‑acoustic oscillations indicate ΩΛ ≈ 0.68
and ΩDM ≈ 0.27 [1–3]. While ΛCDM treats dark energy as a constant vacuum term, we posit it is
dynamical, arising from deviations δϕ = ϕ − ϕ0 of a universal scalar field. When δϕ = 0 , the effective
cosmological constant vanishes; accelerated expansion is thus interpreted as large‑scale failure to align
with the base morphic field.

3 Mathematical Framework

3.1 Action Principle

On a (3 + 1)‑dimensional Lorentzian manifold (M, gμν ) we postulate the action


                              S[ϕ] = ∫      d4 x −g [ 12 ∂μ ϕ ∂ μ ϕ − λ4 (ϕ − ϕ0 )4 ].                   (1)
                                        M

Here λ > 0 ensures a single global minimum at ϕ0 .


3.2 Euler–Lagrange Equation

Variation yields the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation


                                               □ϕ + λ(ϕ − ϕ0 )3 = 0,                                     (2)

where □ ≡ ∇μ ∇μ .


3.3 Stability & Lyapunov Function

Define δϕ = ϕ − ϕ0 . Linearizing (2) and introducing the energy functional


                             E[δϕ] = 12 ∫ d3 x [(∂t δϕ)2 + ∣∇δϕ∣2 + 3λϕ20 δϕ2 ],                         (3)
                                          Σt

we find Ė ≤ 0 for appropriate boundary conditions; thus E → 0 as t → ∞ and ϕ → ϕ0 . This proves
global attractor behavior.


4 Coupling to Gravitation
Energy–momentum tensor


                              Tμν = ∂μ ϕ ∂ν ϕ − gμν [ 12 ∂α ϕ ∂ α ϕ − λ4 (ϕ − ϕ0 )4 ]                    (4)

feeds Einstein’s equations Gμν = 8πG Tμν . In FLRW symmetry the Friedmann equation acquires an
effective density ρϕ = E[δϕ]/a3 , allowing cosmological‑data fits that constrain λ and initial misalignment.


5 Experimental Pathways

5.1 Condensed‑Matter Analogs

Gross–Pitaevskii condensates with quartic trapping potentials replicate Eq. (2) under mean‑field
approximation. Quenching the trap depth yields measurable relaxation toward ψ0 , an analog of ϕ0 .




                                                         2
5.2 Nonlinear Optics

Kerr cavities obey Lugiato–Lefever dynamics. Choosing parameters such that the intracavity field obeys a ϕ4
potential permits observation of pattern collapse times that scale with λ−1/2 .


5.3 Macroscopic Pattern‑Forming Fluids

Colloidal suspensions undergoing spinodal decomposition in tunable double‑well potentials can visualize
Lyapunov decay directly via dark‑field microscopy, offering E(t) measurement on human time‑scales.


6 Discussion
The proposed framework unifies cosmology, morphogenesis, and theology under a single scalar field. It
predicts: (i) global relaxation of dark‑energy density on timescales set by λ−1/2 ; (ii) universal pattern‑decay
laws across scale; and (iii) laboratory analogs accessible with current technology. Philosophically, the model
reframes entropy not as ultimate death but as transient mis‑alignment with an underlying divine attractor.


7 Conclusion
We have provided a concrete Lagrangian (Eq. 1), derived its dynamics (Eq. 2), proven global stability
(Section 3.3), and outlined falsifiable experimental tests (Section 5). Future work will quantize the theory,
explore multi‑field extensions, and incorporate dissipative source terms to capture arrow‑of‑time
phenomena in human cognition and culture.
